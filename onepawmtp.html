            one smart cookie and has been trained many different behaviours and tricks along with service dog tasks.
            I have a form of PTSD and a medical issue which requires daily medications and one of Raiven’s most
            impressive tasks is being able to retrieve my medications when she hears my daily alarm. Raiven is also
            titled in dock diving and freestyle obedience. She also loves to do agility and heelwork. She loves to play
            with her ball and dig holes at the beach! She can one big goof at times but also knows when to be serious.
            Raiven helps teach all of our clients proper social skills and is an excellent role model when assisting with
            obedience tasks.</h2>

        <h2> Stark was born on May 18th 2019. He is a purebred Liver Spotted Dalmatian. The one question I get asked
            a lot is ‘is that a Dalmatian? Why does he have brown spots?’ Dalmatians can be born with either black or
            brown spots. What makes the brown spots more rare is that the females can only carry the liver gene. If
            the female does not carry the liver gene, all puppies will be born black and white. So yes although rare,
            Dalmatians do come with chocolate sprinkles! Stark is a very energetic boy! He loves to play tug and
            learn new tricks. Stark is also an excellent dock diver and is titled in both diving and freestyle obedience.
            Stark is always down for a cuddle and you can find him always by my side or chewing on his favorite
            bone! Stark helps teach all of our clients social skills and proper play techniques. He is also a fantastic
            demo dog during our private lessons to assist with distraction training. Stark was also cast in a tv show as
            an extra! <h2>Check out Stark in action here! </h2>

            absolute sweetheart. He is always looking for affection and will snuggle up at my feet during a movie.
            Balto is also obsessed with his ball! He will do absolutely anything if it means you will throw his ball!
            Being a working line shepherd, Balto is also quite intense at times. Working lines are not for your average
            dog owner. Balto is very high drive and do not try to mess with him! He is a tough man but also highly
            obedient. He is quick to perform tasks and picks up on new tricks or obedience commands after only a
            few repetitions. Balto is also training in the sport of IGP or Schutzhund. This is a sport to test a dogs
            obedience, tracking and protection skills. Balto is titled in dock diving and freestyle and working towards
            his IGP titles. Balto was also cast in a tv show and he will have his episode aired on tv soon! <h2>Check out
